## Self Published Kindling: Memoirs of a Homeless Bookstore Owner

* [Reading “Self Published Kindling: Memoirs of a Homeless Bookstore Owner” by Mik Everett](https://jppreston.com/2015/05/14/reading-self-published-kindling-memoirs-of-a-homeless-bookstore-owner-by-mik-everett/)

> "Written while living out of a broken-down RV in a Wal-Mart parking lot, Self Published Kindling is about Everett’s experience running a Longmont, Colorado, bookstore that stocked exclusively self-published and regional books. Though the first store of its kind in the nation, Everett quickly discovers that few writers read and even fewer readers want books you can’t find in a Barnes and Noble. She tries to mitigate this through author readings and art crawls, but everyone who comes in leaves empty-handed. Soon she and her partner, John, conclude, “Everybody’s just here to pretend they support art” (48). If you’re an artist who’s ever tried to sell their work, you know exactly what that means."

## Turtle: The American Contrition of Franz Ferdinand

> "19-year-old Anne tells her mother, "Your father tried to rape me." Her mother replies, "It's not his fault. These things happen. You're going to have to learn how to deal with it." This is not a story about rape. This is not a story about how Anne was raped or why Anne was raped or whether or not Anne was raped. This is not a story about the truth."
